\subsection*{Task definition}
Develop java command line application searching over file system tree for files with string pattern in body. Use multi-threading approach (note: do not use java.util.concurrent) to provide better performance on parallel controllers. Input -- root directory and string pattern, output -- list of files with pattern found in body. Provide code, single/multi search statistics, explain results.

\section*{Overview}
There are tree different kind of tasks: recursive file listing, file reading and text processing (text pattern search). It easy to see that file processing is more complex and longer procedure than file listing (small amount of data, effective directory caching, simple algorithm).

\subsection*{Implementation}
I've decided to create a pool of threads for file processing (file reading, text processing) and one thread for file listing.

\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance=1cm]
    \node (FileListing) [rectangle, draw=black, rounded corners, fill=blue!30, text centered, anchor=north, text=black, text width=2cm] {
        \textbf{File Listing}
    };
    
    \node (Queue)  [] [rectangle, draw=black, rounded corners, fill=blue!30, text centered, anchor=north, text=black, text width=2cm, right=of FileListing] {
    	\textbf{Queue}
    }
    
    	edge[<-,bend angle=45,semithick] node[auto]{put} (FileListing);
    
   \node(FileProcessing0) [rectangle, draw=black, rounded corners, fill=blue!30, text centered, anchor=north, text=black, text width=4cm, right=of Queue] {
   	\textbf{Reading block / Text searching thread 0 }
   }
   	edge[<-,bend angle=45] node[auto]{get} (Queue);
   
   \node(Dots) [text centered, anchor=north, text=black, text width=4cm, below=of FileProcessing0] {
   	\textbf{...}
   };
   
   \node(FileProcessingN) [rectangle, draw=black, rounded corners, fill=blue!30, text centered, anchor=north, text=black, text width=4cm, below=of Dots] {
   	\textbf{Reading block / Text searching thread N }
   }
   	edge[<-,bend angle=45] node[auto]{get} (Queue);
\end{tikzpicture}

In application parameter you can specify the number of threads for file processing, it makes easy to setup single-thread environment (just set number of threads to 0). In order to determine what is the cost of searching algorithm I've implemented two different kind of text searching algorithm: naive search (complexity: $O(m + n)$) and Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm (complexity: $O(m) + O(n)$), where $m$ -- length of string pattern, $n$ -- length of searchable string.

\subsection*{HDD}

Note: Before each start I'll flush operating system disk cache using command 'purge'.

\subsubsection*{Single-threaded approach}
Algorithm: Naive search and KMP search\\
Files to be processed: 11549\\
String pattern length: 4\\

First of all, let's do profiling to understand what is the most expensive step in our algorithm. Of course, file i/o operations on the first place (actually my hdd is very slow), look at $FileInputStream.read(byte[],int,int)$ -- 74.3\% of CPU time.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=16cm]{0Threads_Naive_11549_Profiling.png}
\end{center}

If we change implementation of the search algorithm with KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) we got results more faster, $FileInputStream.read(byte[],int,int)$ now took about 83.8\% of CPU time (and total execution time less than for previous one for several seconds), that's means our application works more with i/o operations and it is good cause it is main bottleneck for our task. Also, KMP works much more better cause it doesn't use $BufferedInputStream$ $mark(int)$/$reset()$ mechanism (cause it is linear algorithm).

\subsubsection*{Multi-threaded approach}
Algorithm: KMP search (I've decided to use only KMP cause Naive search is too slow)\\
Threads: 2\\
String pattern length: 4\\

According to profiling results for each thread file i/o operations took about 72.1\% and execution result time is decreased.

% \subsection*{Memory drive}

% To reduce cost of the read operation I've decided to create memory drive and test application on memory drive.

\subsection*{Conclusion}
Even on regular HDD using multi-threaded approach I've got better results on some configurations. The results depends on count of threads and size of buffer which is used to read blocks from file. If we have a lot of threads we can see speed degradation cause our threads performs a lot of random access read operations. So, we need to select count of threads according to our resources. Optimal buffer size also can affect the results, cause sequential read in most cases faster than random read.

\subsection*{What's next?}
It is impossible to implement all ideas in short period of time, so, I think it is good to describe what I want to improve next:
\begin{itemize}
\item I think it is possible to get better results by putting i/o operations in separate thread pool. In this case, we can specify count of threads for i/o operations (it depends on controllers count) and we can specify count of thread for text pattern search procedure
\item BufferedInputStream is slow cause it is designed to be thread-safe and there is no way to maintain buffer manually (one worker requires only one buffer). It is possible to get better results using FileChannel API
\item It will be good to test application with memory disk. In this case, file i/o operations are really fast. It is interesting to know the results.
\end{itemize}
